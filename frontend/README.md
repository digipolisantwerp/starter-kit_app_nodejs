# Front-end

You can use any front-end framework or solution you want, but if you want to follow Digipolis' DAAS standards, we recommend one of the following options:

## Digipolis starter kit for React

Go up one level from this folder and type the following commands:

```
> npm install -g @digipolis/start-react
> digipolis-start-react
```

This will overwrite this frontend folder with an ACPaaS UI-ready React app.

## Angular CLI

> Note that this solution requires you to manually install ACPaaS UI and its components.

Go to [https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/acpaas-ui_angular/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/acpaas-ui_angular/blob/master/README.md) for more information about installing ACPaaS UI.

Go to [https://cli.angular.io](https://cli.angular.io) for more information about Angular CLI.
